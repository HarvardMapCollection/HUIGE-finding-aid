Web map for Ana Luiza Nicolae's project, [A Geographical Cat in the Box](https://mapping.share.library.harvard.edu/posts/nicolae/).
Nicolae augmented building data from Harvard University Planning and Design (dataset accessed May 2024) to reflect her research experience, working with Institute of Geographical Exploration materials in various Harvard University archival repositories and special collections.
Since a goal is to have this spatial finding aid last more long term, Belle Lipton (GIS librarian), wanted to host it in a transportable website instead of a commercial map visualization tool, like ArcGIS Online or Felt.com. Lipton used ChatGPT 4.0 in August 2024 to generate Leaflet code, which you can find in `index.html`. Nicolae's augmented building data is `harvard_repositories.json`.
